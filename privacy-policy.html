        <h1>Privacy Policy - Poker Notes AI</h1>
        <p>Last updated: August 13, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our Android application ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Poker Notes AI does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data. All information you create within the App, including notes and photos, is stored exclusively on your local device. Our App requests permission to access your device's <strong>camera</strong> for the sole purpose of its intended functionality, as described below.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use the Camera Permission</h2>
        <p>The <strong>camera permission</strong> is required for the core functionality of allowing you to add photos to your notes within the App. We want to assure you that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Images captured using the camera feature are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers or any other party. We do not have access to them.</li>
            <li>We do not use the images captured for any purpose other than the functionality described above. The camera is only activated upon your specific action to add a photo.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Poker Notes AI is designed with your privacy as a priority. The App does not store any of your data on external servers. All notes, data, and photos you create are stored securely and locally on your own device. You are in complete control of your data. While we take reasonable measures to protect the application itself, the security of your data ultimately depends on you maintaining the security of your own device.</p>

        <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store any of your personal information, photos, or notes, we do not have any user information to share with any third parties. Your data is never sold, traded, or transferred to others by us.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary action.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email: acesuplasvegas@gmail.com</p>
