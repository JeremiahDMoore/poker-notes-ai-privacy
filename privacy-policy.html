        <h1>Privacy Policy - Poker Notes AI</h1>
        <p>Last updated: April 30, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Poker Notes AI collects, uses, and shares information when you use our Android application ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our App requests permission to access your device's <strong>camera</strong>.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use the Camera Permission</h2>
        <p>The <strong>camera permission</strong> is used for the following purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>[**Clearly explain the specific feature that requires camera access. For example:** To allow you to take pictures of poker hands or tables for analysis and note-taking within the App.]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want to assure you that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>[**Specify if you store these images locally or transmit them. For example:** Images captured using the camera feature are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers unless explicitly stated otherwise within a specific feature of the App.]</li>
            <li>[**State if the images are used for any other purpose. For example:** We do not use the images captured for any purpose other than the functionality described above.]</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>[**Describe how data related to the camera usage (if any is stored) is handled. If it's only local, state that clearly. If you transmit and store anything, explain the security measures.** For example: As the images are primarily stored locally on your device, we do not have direct access to them. We implement reasonable security measures to protect any data that might be transmitted or stored by the App, though we acknowledge that no system is completely impenetrable.]</p>

        <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>[**If you share any data collected through the camera (even indirectly), explain with whom and for what purpose. If you don't share this specific data, state that clearly.** For example: We do not share any personal information or images captured through the camera with third parties, except when required by law.]</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>[**If your app is not intended for children under 13, state this.** For example: Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.]</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
